              <p class="section-text">Hi there! I’m Florian-Alin Costache, but you can call me Alin 🌟. I'm currently 
                exploring the exciting world of IT at NHL Stenden University in Emmen. I’m from a beautiful city from Romania, named Ploiesti
                 and I moved to the Netherlands to chase my tech dreams!</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-heading">My Coding Journey</h3>
              <p class="section-text">I like playing with code and have worked in all sorts of programming languages like
                 HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Java, Node.JS, Three.js, C#, Python, MySQL, NoSQL, React  and Kotlin. 
                 I’m super curious about how things work, so I’m also learning C on my own 🧑‍💻...well at least I am trying.</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-heading">Beyond the Screen</h3>
              <p class="section-text">
                When I'm not busy with coding or schoolwork, you can find me playing the piano or enjoying some sports. 
                I used to be the team captain for both volleyball and basketball, which taught me a lot about leadership 
                and teamwork 🏐🏀. Through meditation, I take time to reflect on my life's lessons. 
                It's like pressing the rewind button to learn from what's happened. 
                It's taught me that I’m kind of a daredevil who finds joy in new challenges and unfamiliar experiences. 🌅</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-heading">Let's Connect!</h3>
              <p class="section-text">I'm all about making connections, learning new things, 
                and sharing a smile or two along the way. If you’re curious about tech, music, 
                or just want to share a cool story, hit me up! Thanks for swinging by, and I can't wait to chat with you soon. 🌐</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Enhancing Safety with Tech 🚴‍♂️</h3>
            <p class="section-text">One of my university projects involved working with ANWB to improve bicyclist safety. 
              Our goal was to make the roads safer and we took on this challenge by developing an Android app. 
              This app was designed to detect sudden movements like falls or abrupt stops, and it helped us gather valuable data. 
              This experience was similar to a real job - complete with client interviews and strategy meetings,
               which really pushed my understanding of project execution and client relations.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Financial Management for Sports Clubs 💰 </h3>
            <p class="section-text">With Quintor, I tackled the challenge of creating transparent financial management for sports clubs. 
              I developed an open-source app that standardized financial reporting, with customizable add-ons to suit different needs. 
              My focus was on parsing digital bank statements and processing them into a format that could be easily understood and managed 
              by the clubs, using both NoSQL and SQL databases. This not only sharpened my software development skills but also deepened 
              my knowledge of database management.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Talk to the Coffee Machine ☕ - Don't touch it because Covid</h3>
            <p class="section-text">At Animo, I got to work with a super friendly team on a really cute challenge: getting coffee 
              machines to listen to us! Instead of pushing buttons, we thought, "Why not just ask nicely?" 
              So we tried out fun ways to order a cup of coffee just using our phones or by chatting with a
               website we made super user-friendly with React. 📱 It was like teaching the coffee machine to 
               chat back—super cool, right? This project wasn't just about being tech-savvy; it was about making 
               sure our tech speaks our language, in a way that feels friendly and safe for everyone. ✨</p>

               <h3 class="section-heading">Ethical Hacking Adventure 🛡️💻</h3>
               <p class="section-text">In a cool twist, I dove into the world of Ethical Hacking with a minor that opened my 
                eyes to the world of cybersecurity. I became a detective in the digital realm for a bit, 
                working on a pen test report for a company called Ideea101. Imagine being the good guy who 
                uses hacking powers for great causes! I got to play with all sorts of spy-like tools from 
                Kali Linux and even tried my hand at social engineering—like a tech-savvy Sherlock Holmes. 
                It was an exciting journey, learning that hacking can actually be a force for good! 🌟</p>
              
                <h3 class="section-heading"> Cybersecurity with HackandSea Minor ⚓️🖥️</h3>
                <p class="section-text">I stepped aboard the KASTEELBORG ship at Den Helder port for a unique mission.
                   My task? To conduct a cybersecurity check, known as a pen test, ensuring the digital seas were safe for this vessel.
                  This experience wasn’t just about testing for weaknesses; it was a deep dive into maritime tech. 
                  I learned heaps about the technology that keeps these giant ships sailing smoothly. 
                  A funny thing that I've discovered is that the captain’s chair is the coolest spot on the ship—a real Rolls-Royce chair! 
                  Plus, I found out many ship computers still trust the good old Windows XP to navigate the high seas. 
                  It’s a perfect blend of the old and the new, all working together. 🛳️💼</p>
